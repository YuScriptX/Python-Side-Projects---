# Python Side Projects
Welcome to the Python Side Projects repository!
Here you will find a collection of small Python projects I created to practice and expand my programming skills.


### Usage
Each project has its own folder containing a Python script and a README (sometimes bilingual in English and Dutch) with explanations about the project, rules, and how to use it.

You can run the projects locally by navigating to the project folder and running the script with Python.

### Requirements
Python 3.x

No additional external libraries required (as far as I know, depending on the project)

### Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you want to suggest improvements or add new projects.
